    <p><h5>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5></p>
    <p>John Constantine (/ˈkɒnstənˌtaɪn/)[1] is a fictional character who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Constantine first appeared in Swamp Thing #37 (June 1985), and was created by Alan Moore, Steve Bissette, and John Totleben. </p>
    <p>The titular Hellblazer,[2][3] Constantine is a working-class warlock, occult detective, and con man from Liverpool who is stationed in London. He is known for his endless cynicism, deadpan wit, ruthless cunning, and constant chain smoking, but he is also a passionate humanitarian driven by a heartfelt desire to do some good in his life. Originally a supporting character who played a pivotal role in the "American Gothic" Swamp Thing storyline, Constantine received his own comic in 1988. The musician Sting was a visual inspiration for the character.[4]</p>
    <p>The Hellblazer series was the longest-running and most successful title of DC's Vertigo imprint.[5] Empire ranked Constantine third in their 50 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time,[6] while IGN ranked him number 29 in its Top 100 Comic Book Heroes, and the character ranked number 10 in Wizard's Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time. </p>
    <p>The character made its live-action debut in the film Constantine (2005), played by Keanu Reeves. On television, Constantine was played in the television series Constantine by Matt Ryan, who later reprised the character in the Arrowverse series Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, and The Flash, and several animated productions. Jenna Coleman later portrayed a female version of the character (and her ancestor) in the television series The Sandman, adapting both Constantines' roles from the comic series. </p>
    <p>Some writers who have written his stories have claimed to “see” him.[4][7][8]</p>
